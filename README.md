## Getting Started
Download the repo and install the necessary packages:

    git clone @repo 
    cd ./@repo
    yarn install

## Build
To build the application, simply invoke the build script:

`yarn build`

To run an example, you can run the `index.js` file with node after building - or you can use the execute script:

`yarn execute`

## Test
To test the application, simply invoke the test script:

`yarn test`

To generate a coverage report, invoke the cover script:

`yarn cover`

This will generate a report in the console, and also create a HTML coverage report in the `coverage` folder. To view the report, open the `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html` file in your favourite browser.
